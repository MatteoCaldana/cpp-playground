## Collection of small C++ projects

The origin of these projects is very heterogeneous:
- Some are extensions of exerecises proposed during laboratory sessions I attended as a student between 2014 and 2018
- Some come from my curiosity of understanding better some subjects
- Some are test of code snippets I saw during [Cppcon](https://cppcon.org/)'s presentations 
- Some are undeveloped ideas I had for exercises to propose to students as teaching assistant (during my PhD) for the courses of:
  - [Advanced programming for scientific computing](https://github.com/pacs-course/pacs-examples)
  - [Advanced methods for scientific computing](https://github.com/HPC-Courses/AMSC-Examples)
